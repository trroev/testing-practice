Practicing TDD using Jest

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**

- JavaScript
- Babel
- Jest

**Tools used:**

- VSCode
- Git
- npm

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the benefits of using TDD. It streamlines the process of writing code and keeps you organized and productive. Its very satisfying writing a test and then having it pass when the test is ran! It also helps you think more critically about your code, especially when a test is not passing.
I also learned the basic syntax of Jest and how to use it properly.
